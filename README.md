# Installation 

You can use `nvm use` to configure the node version.

# Stack

A `stack` stores items in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.

Picture a pile of dirty plates in your sink.
As you add more plates, you bury the old ones further down.
When you take a plate off the top to wash it, you're taking the last plate you put in. "Last in, first out."

Write you own implementation of the Stack collection

# Queue

A queue stores items in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.

Picture a queue like the line outside a busy restaurant. First come, first served.
